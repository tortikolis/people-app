                Given the worldwide trends in technology, the current state of affairs in Serbian IT industry and the overall state of education in Serbia, we see a clear opportunity to deliver a modernized education and commoditize certain areas of IT outsourcing market.

                One of the core beliefs of the BIT founding team is in the fact that intellectual potential of our country is utterly underutilized. We took on recruiting it into IT profession, in exceptionally short time periods, via a carefully condensed program.

                The primary goal of our enterprise is employment of our students. Our foremost indicator of our own success is the percentage of candidates who upon completing our condensely structured program find themselves employed. It is designed to maximize chances for employment – based on the worldwide industry trends, localy-tuned in Serbia. It is also intended for yearly revisions in order to stay consistent in the top of the rapidly developing local IT market, effectively increasing the placement rate of our future candidates.
